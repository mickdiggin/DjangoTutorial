# Mini Project 4

## Description
This project is a simple demonstration of Django's ability to make web applications and Bootstrap's abilty to extend a 
site's CSS, HTML, and Javascript code to offer an array of customizable elements.

## Getting Started

### Install requirements with PIP

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Start the server
Invoke the rest of these commands from the mysite directory.
```
python manage.py runserver
```

### Create local database for testing
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create superuser account to use the admin console
```
 python manage.py createsuperuser
```
## Help
If you experience any errors getting your dev server up and running, Django has 
[excellent troubleshooting documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/). Please note that you may have to 
invoke the runserver command more than once.
